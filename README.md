## What does this do
It makes it easier to send messages to the server
when an app is opened... has to be a PYTHON app.
## How to use
### How to install
Open your terminal and type in:
```
pip install apprun
```
Make sure pip is installed!
### Using
So when your in your .py file, type in these things:
```py
title = "TitleHere" #Put your title here!

OpenMsg() #Sends the message
```
The "TitleHere" is what the title is.
OpenMsg() sends the message.
## Why does this exist?
Because I needed something easier for apps I'm making, most are console based
so thats why most people need it.
